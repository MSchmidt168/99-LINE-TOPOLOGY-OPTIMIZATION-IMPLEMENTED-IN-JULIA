# 99-LINE-TOPOLOGY-OPTIMIZATION-IMPLEMENTED-IN-JULIA
Hello,
i tryed to implement the famous "99-LINE TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION" from Ole Sigmund witten in MATLAB to Julia. I used jupyter notebooks and tested the code on 4 examples. Every example needed a small modification so you need to look at the seperate notebooks. A general notebook (Allgemeine Funktionen) was used to store general functions. This notebook is integred in all example-notebooks with the package NBIncude.
